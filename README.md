BERT Fine-Tuning for Question Answering
This repository contains code for fine-tuning BERT on a question-answering dataset. The model learns to predict answers based on given contexts, making it useful for NLP applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated Q&A systems.

Project Overview
Implements BERT fine-tuning using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
Uses pre-trained BERT models to improve question-answering performance.
Processes custom financial datasets and converts them into a structured Q&A format.
Evaluates the model’s performance using Hugging Face's Trainer API.
Setup & Requirements
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/HariBejju/fine-tuning-basics.git
cd fine-tuning-basics
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install transformers datasets torch
3. Run the Notebook
Open Bertfinetune.ipynb and execute the cells to preprocess data, fine-tune the model, and evaluate its performance.

Dataset Details
The dataset consists of financial company data transformed into question-answer pairs. The model is trained to extract correct answers from the given financial context.

Model & Training Details
Uses BERT (bert-base-uncased) from Hugging Face.
Fine-tunes with Hugging Face Trainer API for efficient optimization.
Implements tokenization, loss calculation, and evaluation metrics for performance analysis.
Results & Performance
After fine-tuning, the model is capable of extracting accurate answers from structured text. Further improvements can be made by hyperparameter tuning and dataset expansion.

Future Improvements
Experimenting with other transformer models like RoBERTa or T5.
Fine-tuning on a larger dataset for better generalization.
Deploying the trained model using FastAPI or Flask for real-time inference.
