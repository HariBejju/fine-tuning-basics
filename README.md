BERT Fine-Tuning for Question Answering
This repository contains code for fine-tuning BERT on a question-answering dataset. The model learns to predict answers based on given contexts, making it useful for NLP applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated Q&A systems.

🚀 Project Overview
Implements BERT fine-tuning using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
Uses pre-trained BERT models to improve question-answering performance.
Processes custom financial datasets and converts them into a structured Q&A format.
Evaluates the model’s performance using Hugging Face's Trainer API.

📂 Dataset Details
The dataset consists of financial company data, transformed into question-answer pairs. The model is trained to extract the correct answers from the given financial context.

🧠 Model & Training Details
Uses BERT (bert-base-uncased) from Hugging Face.
Fine-tunes using Hugging Face Trainer API for efficient optimization.
Implements tokenization, loss calculation, and evaluation metrics for performance analysis.
📊 Results & Performance
After fine-tuning, the model is capable of extracting accurate answers from structured text. Further improvements can be made by:
✔️ Hyperparameter tuning
✔️ Expanding the dataset

🔮 Future Improvements
Experimenting with other transformer models like RoBERTa or T5.
Fine-tuning on a larger dataset for better generalization.
Deploying the trained model using FastAPI or Flask for real-time inference.
